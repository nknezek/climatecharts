# City Climate Visualizations

This is a repository with code to visualiaze the average yearly climate of various cities around the world, inspired by the fantastic site [weatherspark.com](http://weatherspark.com). The data for this project was obtained from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 ([MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/)) and Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily ([GHCN-D](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn)) datasets. 

In these visualizations, the year progresses clockwise around the circle, with January 1st at 12 o'clock, April at 3, July at 6, and October at 9. Then, time of day progresses radially outward. The color represents the typical daily temperature throughout the day, with the color scale cold to hot represented purple-blue-green-yellow-red. The shaded portions of the chart represent nighttime, with discontinuities in sunrise/sunset due to daylight savings time. Finally, typical rainfall (blue) and snowfall (purple) throughout the year is represented in the inner circle. 

Shown below are climate chart examples for four cities in which I've lived: Berkeley, CA; Sanger, TX; Hanover, NH; and Honolulu, HI. Note the stability of the climate in Berkeley and Honolulu, and the extreme cold in Hanover and heat in Sanger. Also interesting are the very different patterns of rainfall throughout they year, with Berkeley's rainy season in late winter, Sanger's occuring in early summer and fall, and Honolulu's in early winter. Additional city visualizations of Hong Kong and Seattle, WA can be found in the [charts folder](https://github.com/nknezek/climatecharts/tree/master/charts).
