# City Climate Visualizations

This is a repository with code to visualiaze the average yearly climate of various cities around the world, inspired by the fantastic site [weatherspark.com](http://weatherspark.com). The data for this project was obtained from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 ([MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/)) and Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily ([GHCN-D](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt)) datasets. 

In these visualizations, the year progresses clockwise around the circle, with January at 12-o'clock, April at 3, July at 6, and October at 10 o'clock. Then, time of day progresses from inside to outside each day. The color represents the typical daily temperature throughout the day, with the color scale from cold to hot being purple-blue-green-yellow-red. The shaded portions of the chart represent night-time, with discontinuities in sunrise/sunset due to daylight savings time. Finally, for some cities typical rainfall (blue) and snowfall (purple) is represented in the inner circle.
